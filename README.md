## Builts
- This Psychic Game is built with HTML and Javascript

## Logic

I use function and if else statement for the logic of the game.
In the three statements, the first one check if it is a letter or number,
second statement check if the character guess is equal to the computer generated letter,
The Final checks if there is any guess are left.
